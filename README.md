# Parkinson's Disease Detection Project

This project focuses on detecting Parkinson's disease using advanced machine learning techniques. It leverages patient data to identify patterns and predict the likelihood of Parkinson's disease, assisting in early diagnosis and intervention.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model capable of distinguishing between healthy individuals and those affected by Parkinson's disease. The dataset typically includes voice measurements and other relevant biomarkers, which are analyzed using machine learning algorithms.

### Features:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection for optimal model performance.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression for prediction.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model effectiveness.
- **Visualization:** Graphical representation of data distribution and model performance.
- **User Interface (Optional):** A simple interface for inputting patient data and obtaining predictions.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for analysis and experimentation)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/parkinsons-detection.git
    cd parkinsons-detection
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Ensure the dataset is placed in the appropriate directory.
2. Run the model training script:

    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

3. (Optional) Use the prediction interface:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Dataset
The model is trained on publicly available Parkinson's disease datasets, such as the UCI Parkinson's dataset. Ensure you adhere to the dataset's licensing and ethical usage guidelines.
